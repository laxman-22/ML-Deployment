This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app) to create a website that can predict the survivability of Titanic passengers based on passenger attributes. The flask server is located [here](https://github.com/laxman-22/ML-Flask-Server) as the repo is attached to Render who is hosting the flask server and this website is hosted by Vercel. With the current configuration the Flask API will not respond to local servers as it is purely linked to this [link](https://ml-deployment-65gi.vercel.app)

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.
